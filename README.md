# StarStack
Editing long exposure pictures to get rid of light pollution.  I needed to use filters on my iPhone to highlight certain features, then I put those features together into one image using this program.

The light pollution in my area was pretty bad, and since I was using my phone to shoot long exposure shots (10 seconds), I wasn't able to have much support getting rid of light pollution.
By adjusting things such as brightness and sharpness, I was able to get some stars near the center of the image to pop more, or stars on the outskirts of the image pop more.  Sadly, I couldn't do both at the same time.
After filtering manually to emphasise stars, this program helps clean up some of the left over light pollution, then combine the images to produce a final product.

This is not necessairly supposed to work with maximal effeciency, but instead is a proof of concept.
